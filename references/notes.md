### FTSE All Share

The FTSE All-Share Index, originally known as the FTSE Actuaries All Share Index, is a capitalisation-weighted index, comprising around 600 of more than 2,000 companies traded on the London Stock Exchange. As at 29 December 2017 the constituents of this index totalled 641 companies (source FTSE Russell All-Share Index fact sheet). It aims to represent at least 98% of the full capital value of all UK companies that qualify as eligible for inclusion. The index base date is 10 April 1962 with a base level of 100.

To qualify, companies must have a full listing on the London Stock Exchange with a Sterling or Euro denominated price on SETS or SETSmm or a firm quotation on SEAQ or SEATS, and must meet a number of other eligibility requirements.

FTSE All-Share is the aggregation of the FTSE 100 Index, FTSE 250 Index and FTSE SmallCap Index.
